I'm bold and curious!
I'm passionate about data, love learning new skills, I'm not afraid of asking questions, but I'm also humble and like getting along with everyone.
I'm probably not the best technically speaking, I'm don't know the last bleeding edge deep learning algorithm, but I know the basics of Machine Learning, Statistics and programming, I can communicate to different people with different roles (from the lay business person to the technical software engineer), I can retrieve value from data and make the black-box algorithms more interpretable.
Lastly, I'm thriving for new professional challenges, learning a new language, a new culture, traveling and contributing to great projects!

Best regards,
Jayme
